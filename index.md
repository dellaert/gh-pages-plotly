## Introduction
This page combines static html generated by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with Plotly React components. It is generated from the files in the gh-pages branch of [this GitHub template](https://github.com/dellaert/gh-pages-plotly). 

Here is a fancy plot:

<div id="fancy"></div>

and here is a fully-fledged pivot table:

<div id="pivot"></div>

In addition, as is customary with Jekyll sites, the `News` tab is generated based on markdown files in the `_posts` folder.

## Code Structure
The above is rendered based on this markdown code in `index.md`:

```md
Here is a fancy plot:

<div id="fancy"></div>

and here is a fully-fledged pivot table:

<div id="pivot"></div>
```

and the code in [src/entry.jsx](/src/entry.jsx) which renders the React components in `src/components` into the divs above:

``` js
ReactDOM.render(<Fancy />, document.getElementById('fancy'));
```

The `Fancy` component in [src/components/Fancy.jsx](/src/components/Fancy.jsx) is based on the [React Plotly Example](https://plotly.com/javascript/react/). This is currently using [this "official" hack](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js/blob/master/README.md#loading-from-a-script-tag) as I can't make react-plotly play nice with yarn/webpack.

The `PivotTable` components [src/components/PivotTable.jsx](/src/components/PivotTable.jsx) is based on https://react-pivottable.js.org/ .

## Development
To start development based on this, clone this [this GitHub template](https://github.com/dellaert/gh-pages-plotly), check out the gh-pages branch, and edit the .md and .jsx files (in the src folder).

The package manager used is [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and three scripts are configured in [package.json](package.json) to help you:
 
1. To type-check your js/jsx code using [flow](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/components/), execute

    > yarn flow

1. To build the javascript source in `build.js`, execute

    > yarn build

1. To preview the site locally, execute

    > yarn start

Happy building!
